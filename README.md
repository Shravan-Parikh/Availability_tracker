# Availability_tracker
 To get the most common-time to schedule a meeting between different collegaues in different timezones.

# Approach
-Firstly convert all the time in a single common Timezone i.e target Time zone

-Now find the most common time from the available time given by the different user

-I have used python inbuilt datetime library so that everything is paresd in time format itself
 HH:MM hour and minutes which makes everything easy to process.
